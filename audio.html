			<h1>Music is Essential to Meme Culture</h1>
			<p>Music has been engrained in Human Culture since the first caveman smacked a bone against a rock and liked the sound. Memes, being part of human culture, are interwoven with music.
				Youtube was one of the first places for musical memes to catch on. By the start of the 2010's, most music memes came from youtube. Some notable examples are choclate rain and trolololol.
				As the decade went on, musical memes experienced the same shift as mainstream memes, becoming more abstract. Darude Sandstorm comes to mind. Many musical memes also come from video games or tv shows, like spongebob and Lazytown.
				For this category I am choosing megalovania, because it has been a big part of meme culture ever since Undertale was released. Plus it's a banger.</p>
