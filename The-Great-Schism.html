					<p>In the year leading up to the great skism, there was new rivalry in meme culture, normal memes and "dank" memes. Normal memes were a continuation of past meme culture, but the new "dank" memes relied on dark humor and more abstract and ironic concepts. This divide continued to incrase, but most people were on both sides, until a gorilla was shot at Cincinnati Zoo in May of 2016. Dank memers immediately started to make jokes about it, but normal memers, or "normies" didn't understand the joke. From this point on, Normies and Dank memers were enemies. As normie memes began to drift up the age brackets, becoming much more popular by facebook moms, or Karens. This would crete a generational meme gap, that would manifest later into "OK BOOMER" in mid 2019.</p>
